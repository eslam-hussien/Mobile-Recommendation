#Mobill Algorithm
User Input >>>>>> Budget , Answer for prefrence questions
For Budget >> there are two  options first to let it empty OR second to choose one of the prices from the dropdown list 
For the prefrence questions >> the user will see 13 checkboxs he will check whatever he want then in the next page he will choose what is the group of each 
chocie then in the next page he will choose the priority of each component in each group 
Example 
Budget>> 5000
user checked >> photography , media , storage and phone calls >>> those options will be showen in the next page then >>>
HE will choose in each group what to add in >> We have 3 Groups Important , mediam and low >. 
user will choose important for media and sorage , And he will choose mediam for  photography , And he will choose low for phone calls.
In the next page >> He will choose the priority in each group example in important group>> for media he will put 1 , for storage he will put 2 ..etc
Then the output will be as the following 
IF Budget = True "Have a value "{
HE will see three sections in the result page
1-Best mobile for your prefrences within the budget
	This option is optained by the following steps 
	1-filter the data according to the price"Budget" Enterd from the user
	2-Normalize the data with the following equation y=x-mix/max-min(new_max-new_min)+new_min  where y is the result x is the value we want to normalize 
	max is the hightest value in the current column , min is the lowest value in the same column , new_max=1 , new_min=0.
	Example : if the user choosed media and media refers in the mapping to cpu , screen and ram 
	the system will retreive those 3 columns from the database we already filterd with the input price and make normalization to those 3 columns with the equation
	mentioned above.
	3-Calculate each group weight Like what you did before ( 5, 3 ,1 ) then depends on what user will input the weights will be distributed 
	4-From the mapping we will get common components from the user choices we will sum the result for each compnent
	5-then we will get like storage=0.8 , screen=7.5 , cpu= 0.3 
	6-we will multiply each weight in the normalized data 
	example for storage column for 0.8*normalized value 
	7- sum all scores for each record (raw) and we will get a new column called totalscore
	8-Arrange this table descinding then show top 10 mobiles for the user
2- price/total scores the n arrange descesnding (Best value for money )
	Starting from step 8 Arrange this table descinding then show top 10 mobiles for the user **
	1- We will make normalization again y=x-mix/max-min(new_max-new_min)+new_min But this time new_max will be 10 and new_min will be 1
	2- calculate price/total score After NORmalization 
	3-Arrange the table again descinding then show top 10 mobiles 
3-clusters within the budget 
	Assume we have 4 clusters price Ranges from 0-3000 , 3200-7000 , 7150-11000, 11500-22000
	Assume that the user choosed the budget 5000
	We will make the same previous steps in 1st output But we will make those steps 1st in the cluster from 3200-7000 , then in the cluster 0-3000 
	At the end we will show in this section 6 mobiles 3 from the 1st cluster Range (Within user budget) ,and second we will show 3 mobiles from second cluster Lower one 
	 
}
Else "Budget=False (Empty)"{
1-Best mobile
	Like Best mobile for your prefrences within the budget But wih NO BUDGET LIMIT OR FILTER
2-best value for the money without budget limit
	Like price/total scores then arrange descesnding (Best value for money) BUT NO BUDGET LIMIT or filter
3-best mobile within each cluster 
	Like clusters within the budget 
	But we will make the algorithm run and get results from all the clusters we have 
	REsult will be As the following 
	In cluster 0-3000 we recommend (Mobil Name + price )
	In cluster 3200-7000 we recommend (Mobil Name + price )
	In cluster 7150-11000 we recommend (Mobil Name + price )
	In cluster 11500-22000  we recommend (Mobil Name + price )
